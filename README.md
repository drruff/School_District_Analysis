# School_District_Analysis


## Project Overview
School board expected academic dishonesty amongst Thomas High School's 9th grade, this project is inteeded to verify if there is evidence of this in the data for grades with those who passed in math and reading.

If there is indeed academic dishonesty we should see some changes changes in the two analysis.
